# Smith Inventory System

The Smith Inventory System is an open source, inventory management system that can be used in small or large projects.  This project utilizes Electron JS to create a platform independent solution for managing your inventory projects.

## Getting started
The easiest way to test out the SIS software is by downloading one of our packaged versions. You will need a url and a key before you can access the software.  Both of which can be requested to Rob O'Connell at Smith College Libraries [https://libraries.smith.edu/about/staff-directory/rob-oconnell] 

If you would like to run the software locally you can do so by following these steps

1. You will want to have the following npm packages installed before starting - electron-forge and yarn
2. Clone the git repository
3. cd to the download folder
4. yarn install
5. After your packages have installed you can then use electron-forge start to run the application.
